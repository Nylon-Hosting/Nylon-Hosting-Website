# Understanding Load Balancers

When your app starts growing, you'll hit a point where just one server isn't enough. Thatâ€™s where **load balancers** step in.

They distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single machine is overwhelmed.

## Benefits

- Higher availability  
- Improved performance  
- Redundancy in case of failure  

```js
// A basic load balancer logic example (not for production!)
const servers = ['server1', 'server2', 'server3'];
let current = 0;

function getServer() {
  const server = servers[current];
  current = (current + 1) % servers.length;
  return server;
}
